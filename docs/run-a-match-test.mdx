## Before Running the Test

In order to ensure the best results when running any testing, we recommend you follow  
these simple guidelines when preparing your audience file:

1. Your audience file should be in .CSV format. Here is a template from [FullContact’s Platform](https://platform.fullcontact.com/match/Input_Fields_Template.csv?v=db61f5303ad4e239d0a6a56fb9eee6b4).
2. Your list should be a random sample of your customers, with at least 100 records and up to 200k.
	- A truly random sample will provide the most accurate results when running a match test. We do not recommend running match tests on your best or worst customer records, as that will skew your results.
	- Need a larger sample analyzed? Reach out to your sales representative
3. We recommend that you provide as many acceptable customer inputs as possible, in the correct formatting.
