title: "Obtain Enrichment Data"
description: "After running a [Match Test](https://docs.fullcontact.com/docs/run-a-match-test-1), you may want to see a sample of actual Enrichment Data that FullContact offers alongside your actual, submitted customer data."
---

FullContact can provide up to 1,000 records of enriched data, all thru the FullContact Platform.

<Note>
**Note: this is a manual process.**

A FullContact Solution team member will perform the API enrichment on your behalf, and deliver the files to your Platform account. Please reach out to [solutions@fullcontact.com](https://docs.fullcontact.com/docs/) to make a request.
