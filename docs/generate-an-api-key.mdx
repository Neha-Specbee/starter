## How to Generate an API Key

Let's do a simple walkthrough showing you how to create a new API key within the FullContact Platform.

<Steps>
<Step>
Start by logging in to the [FullContact Platform](https://platform.fullcontact.com/login). If you don’t have an account, [start by creating one](https://platform.fullcontact.com/register) for free.

</Step>

Once authenticated, click on **Settings** in the navigation on the left side.

A modal will display, asking you to name your API Key. We've chosen a generic name in this screenshot, but you should choose a name that will help you remember how you are using this particular key.

After naming your API key, click **Save**.

</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
After you click **Save**, we will display your key in plain text in a modal that looks like this.

Copy your key and store is somewhere safe. As the instructions state, this is the only time we will display this key to you. If you lose your key, you will need to come back and generate a new one to use for your integration / application.
