FullContact accepts identity fragments as inputs (email, phone, name + address, etc...) and - using our person-centered graph - unifies and maps these disparate identifiers into a single person. In addition, FullContact can provide additional rich insights about your customers to drive personalization all in a privacy safe manner.

## The Identity Graph
Our graph consists of data fragments of an individual, which are connected to build a whole-person picture. This includes both personal and professional identities and hundreds of marketing attributes about a person which can be queried by the graph to identify the individual person from the billions of people in the Identity Graph. As a person’s data changes, our graph dynamically updates, making observations to choose the most accurate and up-to-date information.
